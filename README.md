Code, CAD + STLs, wiring diagram, and everything else needed to replicate our Arduino servo-driven hands for a Doctor Octopus cosplay.  
If you have questions, please contact me!

Files in this GitHub:

## CAD
1) SolidWorks2022
    Has all STL files, but in SoldWorks to allow for changes
2) Has all STLs used for project

## one_hand_at_t_time
Contains the Arduino .ino file (named the same) so it's possible to open in the Arduino IDE without copying to another file.

## wiring
The annotated wiring diagram made using KiCad. 

## Parts
This project couldn't have been made without the amazing tutorials and parts from Adafruit. Get the parts from their website:

Other parts acquired elsewhere:
1) USB battery bank
2) USB-C cable (for charger), USB-A/B (for Arduino)
3) Printer filament
4) All soldering / wire / tools.
5) Backpack, wood, paint, electrical conduit, etc.
